# Linux is Free
A website dedicated to sharing Linux with the world.

I started this website in the hope of educating the common person about Linux, so that more people can end up trying it or learning more. If you'd like to view it in action, click the link below:

EOL: Am archiving this repo, as I have decided to not pursue continuing the project. I also no longer own the domain, FYI.
